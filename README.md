# JSProject-Stone-Paper-Scissor
This project involves building a Rock, Paper, Scissors game based on a provided Figma design. 
The challenge is to create the game and make it visually as close as possible to the design, while implementing all the necessary features.
Problem Statement
The objective is to develop an interactive game where:
You (the player) face off against the computer in a Rock, Paper, Scissors match.
Both you and the computer make your selections simultaneously.
Features List
Two-player Game (Player vs Computer):
The game involves two participants: the human player and the computer opponent.
Both players make their moves simultaneously (player manually selects one of stone, paper, or scissors; computer randomly chooses one based on logic).
Real-time Score Tracking:
Display scores for both the player and the computer on the screen.
Update the scores after each round.
Win/Loss Messages:
Display a relevant message indicating the outcome of each round (win, loss, or tie).
Rules Pop-up:
A rules section is located at the bottom right corner of the screen.
Clicking on the rules section opens a pop-up explaining the basic rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
The pop-up includes a close button to hide the rules again.
Local Storage for Scores:
Store the player and computer scores using local storage so that the scores persist even if the page is reloaded.
Winning Animation:
If the player wins a round, a celebration animation is triggered to enhance the user experience.
Game Rules
